Enhance the visual prompt with American comic book art direction:
- Style: American comic book (Marvel/DC inspired), bold ink outlines, halftone dot patterns
- Character features: heroic proportions, muscular anatomy, dynamic poses, detailed costumes
- Use dramatic foreshortening and extreme perspective angles
- Include action lines, impact bursts, and kinetic energy effects
- Lighting: high contrast chiaroscuro, dramatic spotlighting, neon glow effects
- Color palette: saturated primary colors (red, blue, yellow), deep shadows, vibrant highlights
- Backgrounds: detailed urban cityscapes, dramatic skies, destruction debris
- Panel composition: Dutch angles, worm's eye view, bird's eye view for variety
- Text effects: integrate onomatopoeia (BOOM, CRASH, ZAP) as graphic design elements
- Maintain consistent character designs with heroic Western comic aesthetics throughout
